        <h2><em>Hello! My name is Christabel and I am currently a university student studying a
        Bachelor's Degree in Digital Arts. Here I will be writing about my favourite topic within 
        my Applied Software Practices study-unit; <strong>2D Sprite Animation & 3D 
        Scuplting</strong>.</em>
        </h2>
 
    <br> <br> <br>
    <h3><strong>Basic Information</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <p>This topic mainly served as an introductory unit which introduced us – the 
        students – to two very important software programs, these being <strong>Unity</strong> and 
        <strong>Blender</strong>. Unity is a game engine which enables users to create interactive 
        games and apps whilst Blender is 3D graphics software which could be used for 
        numerous purposes such as for animation and computer games.
    </p>
    <p>For more information about Unity and Blender one could visit their official 
        website from the following links:

    </ul>
    <br> <br>
    <h3><strong>Practical Assignments</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <p>As part of our requirements for this topic we had to submit two deliverables. 
        One of these deliverables required the production of an <strong>animation of a 2D 
        character</strong> of our choice. The 2D character was to be created through Piskel (an 
        online editor for pixel art) doing multiple actions which was then to be 
        exported as a sprite sheet. This sprite sheet is then used to create the 
        animation through Unity.

        <source src="Alien Animation.webm" type="video/webm">
    </video>
    <h2><em>2D character animation developed from a sprite sheet which contained my alien character.</em>
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>As for the second deliverable we had to sculpt a <strong>3D still life of a fruit bowl</strong>
        containing a couple of fruits by using the Blender software and present it as a 
        turntable animation. 
    </p>
    <br> 
    <img src="Fruit Bowl.png" width="600" height="350">
    <video controls width="600" height="400" loop autoplay>
        <source src="Fruit Bowl.webm" type="video/webm">
    </video>
    <h2><em>Turntable animation and image showing my 3D sculpted fruit bowl.</em>
    </h2>
    <br> <br>
    <h3><strong>Personal Viewpoint</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <p>I really enjoyed working on these assignments especially the 3D still life. The 
        main reason as to why this is so is because these assignments gave me a small 
        insight as to what I am really interested in doing in the near future.
